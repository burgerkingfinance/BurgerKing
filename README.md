# BurgerKing

BUK is a cryptocurrency based on the TRC20 network issued by the BurgerKing Finance project. BUK aims to help users lower the DEFI threshold and reduce tedious operations, so that they can participate in Defi Mining more freely.


Currently, there are many DeFi projects that have been developing on many different platforms. It proves that this is the inevitable development trend of the financial platform on the blockchain platform.
However, currently there are very few fully developed platforms that satisfy the needs of all users. Or there are projects that have been developed for a long time, which are no longer suitable for the rapid development of the era. There are also many users who feel it is too late to get involved in today’s projects because they’ve grown too far.
